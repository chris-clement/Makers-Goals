## Daily Goals

### Wednesday 17th November 

- Start Tracking my Goals in Github. :white_check_mark:

Completed. Going to make this a daily task.

- Debug Challenge 10 on the Boris Bikes task. :white_check_mark:

This can be achieved by writing better unit tests. At the moment I think this is where we are running into issues.

- Attend the optional workshop on classes. :white_check_mark:

Great workshop where I learnt more about using attr reader and instance variables.

- Get to Challenge 13 on the Boris Bikes task. :white_check_mark: (sort of)

Managed to get to the end of challenge 12. Taking things a bit slower to try and fully understand each step.

### Thursday 18th November

- Attend the 'Intro to Debugging' workshop. 

This should help with the Boris Bikes Challenge we are currently working on this week with our pair.

Ties in nicely with the weekly goal of follow an effective debugging process.

- Progress through the Boris Bike Challenge. 

Aim is to progress through a few more challenges. 

We are with a new partner today so it will be a good experience seeing how others approach the challenges.

- Attend Yoga.

Important to not neglect exercise and meditation.
