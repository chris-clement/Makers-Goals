# Week 1

## Weekly Goals 

- Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
- Pair using the driver-navigator style
- Follow an effective debugging process
- Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

## Self-Review

- Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods :white_check_mark:

Evidence? Boris Bike challenge. I followed a procedure of feature testing, writing unit tests, RED (Fail the test), GREEN (Change the code to pass the test), REFACTOR then repeat.

Assesment? I now see more clearly the benefits of TDD. It helps to outline what you want the program to achieve and breaks down the larger problem into smaller chunks.

- Pair using the driver-navigator style :white_check_mark:

Evidence? Spent more than 16 hours doing this with two different pairs. Switched after each challenge to ensure I was doing both driver and navigator roles.

Assesment? Enjoyed this aspect a lot. Learnt to communicate my ideas and collaborate with different people. 

- Follow an effective debugging process :white_check_mark:

Evidence? Attended the workshop on this and learnt how to read the error messages more clearly. 

Assesment? I now follow a more systematic approach to debugging that helps me identify exactly where the issues are.

- Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP :white_check_mark:

Evidence? Can explain to a peer what these concepts are.

Assesment? Definitely understand SRP and the benefit of having methods which do a single thing. It clearly seperates functions and makes for a more readable code. I understand encapsulation from a Class perspective but need to read more on the topic to understand where else it is used.

## Daily Goals

### Wednesday 17th November 

- Start Tracking my Goals in Github. :white_check_mark:

Feedback: Completed. Going to make this a daily task.

- Debug Challenge 10 on the Boris Bikes task. :white_check_mark:

This can be achieved by writing better unit tests. At the moment I think this is where we are running into issues.

Feedback: Managed to complete the challenge through debugging line by line.

- Attend the optional workshop on classes. :white_check_mark:

Feedback: Great workshop where I learnt more about using attr reader and instance variables.

- Get to Challenge 13 on the Boris Bikes task. :white_check_mark: (sort of)

Feedback: Managed to get to the end of challenge 12. Taking things a bit slower to try and fully understand each step.

### Thursday 18th November

- Attend the 'Intro to Debugging' workshop. :white_check_mark:

This should help with the Boris Bikes Challenge we are currently working on this week with our pair.

Ties in nicely with the weekly goal of follow an effective debugging process.

Feedback: Learnt to read the errors more thoroughly. The issue here was with the Gem file rather than the face of the code.

- Read about the differences between attr reader, attr writer, attr accessor. :white_check_mark:

To be able to explain the differences to a peer.

Feedback: Say you have a instance variable in a class that you want to be able to access outside of this class. 

You can do this through accessors. 

It is a shorcut to having to define each one. 

You can use attr_reader, attr_writer and attr_accesor (both read and write).

And include them in your initialize def.

- Progress through the Boris Bike Challenge. :white_check_mark:

Aim is to progress through 3 more challenges. 

We are with a new partner today so it will be a good experience seeing how others approach the challenges.

Feedback: Figured out how to collaborate with someone new on Github. We made a new repo and then we aligned our code to be able to then start working together.

Managed to get through 2 challenges. They are getting tougher each time but progress is being made.


### Friday 19th November

- Attend Retro Workshop :white_check_mark:

Feedback: Retro is a retrospective look at how you tackled a challenge/project. Good to debrief on how we have tackled the Boris Bike challenge so far.

- Get through 4 Boris Bike Challenges :white_check_mark:


Stretch target given the increasing level of difficulty.

Feedback: Managed to finish challenge 19 of the Boris Bike challenge. Looking at the code I am pleased with how far we got.

- Be able to explain encapsulation and SRP :white_check_mark:

Feedback: Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods within one unit i.e. a Class.
SRP: Single responsibility principle. Each method should be responsible for one thing only, this makes it clearer and good practice to seperate the responsibilities.
