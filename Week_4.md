## Weekly Goals 

- Build a simple web app with a database
- Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
- Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships between tables)

## Self-Review

- Build a simple web app with a database

Evidence? Chitter challenge, bookmark manager app

Assesment? I have managed to build a simple bookmark manager which stores a users chosen websites. The functionality allows for bookmarks to be added, updated and deleted meaning I have made a CRUD application.

- Follow an effective debugging process for database applications

Evidence?  Evident in my approach to dealing with database applications. Having TablePlus open to see how my application is impacting these tables in real time.

Assesment? I am starting to print lines of code more to see what results are returned in a terminal or web browser. This helps especially with web apps as there are many different files being used at once. Understanding where in the process I have reached is really helpful in focusing in on the issues.

- Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships between tables)

Evidence? Shown in my bookmark manager challenge, evidenced my understanding by building a mock twitter app in just a matter of hours over the weekend.

Assesment? I understand how to use PostgreSQL, building databases, using SQL queries to create these databases and tables within them. How to implement them within a Sinatra web application.
