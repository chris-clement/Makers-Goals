# Week 3

## Weekly Goals 

- Build a simple web app
- Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
- Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
- Explain the MVC pattern

## Self-Review

- Build a simple web app

Evidence? This is most evident by the Rock, Paper, Scissors weekend challenge.

Assesment? I have achieved this. I can make a simple web app that is functional. I can improve on this by learning CSS and adding this to my html pages.

- Follow an effective debugging process for web applications

Evidence? Attended a workshop on this exact goal. I can now follow this when debugging a web application I have built.

Assesment? I now have a logical flow to debugging a web app. Identifying if the issue lies with the Model, View or controller aspect of the web app.

- Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)

Evidence? I have a basic level of understanding on these topics. 

Assesment? Need to strengthen my understanding of these topics so I feel comfortable explaining it to a peer. 

- Explain the MVC pattern

Evidence? I implemented this in my weekend challenge. Seperating out Model, View and Controller into their respective parts.

Assesment? I understand this concept and how it applies to web applications.
