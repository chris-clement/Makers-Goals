# Week 6

## Weekly Goals 

- Test-drive a simple Javascript program using Node.
- Explain how asynchronous programming is different from synchronous, blocking programming.
- Apply a coherent process to learn a new language.

## Self-Review

- Test-drive a simple Javascript program using Node.

Evidence? Thermostat repo.

Assesment? Given we only had 4 days to do this I am pleased with how well I was able to pick up Javascript from not knowing it at all before the start of the week.


- Explain how asynchronous programming is different from synchronous, blocking programming.

Evidence? My understanding is the following: "When you execute something synchronously, you wait for it to finish before moving on to another task. When you execute something asynchronously, you can move on to another task before it finishes."

Assesment? I would like to read more on the topic to fully appreciate the differences.


- Apply a coherent process to learn a new language.

Evidence? Bowling challenge JS

Assesment? I was able to start the bowling challenge from scratch written in JS. I managed to get further than I did when writing my code in Ruby so I am overall very pleased with my progress.
