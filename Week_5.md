# Week 5

## Weekly Goals 

- Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
- Build to a specification (rather than challenges)
- Run stand-ups and retrospectives
- Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
- Give and receive meaningful code review

## Self-Review

- Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs

Evidence? Makers BnB

Assesment? We did this succesfully by breaking down the project into pieces that could be worked on independently.

- Build to a specification (rather than challenges)

Evidence? Makers BnB

Assesment? No input from coaches, we led this project on our own. We identified the Minimum Viable Product and delivered that with a few bonus features such as implementing a nice layout using CSS.

- Run stand-ups and retrospectives

Evidence? Makers BnB performed daily.

Assesment? We stuck to this and it helped to focus us on what we wanted to achieve that day. It was good to have the retro in the early afternoon to look back on what we had achieved.

- Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow

Evidence? MakersBnB

Assesment? This was tricky to begin with as there were a lot of conflicts to resolve. I will look to use branches in future projects.

- Give and receive meaningful code review

Evidence? MakersBnB presentation.

Assesment? We were able to answer any queries the group/coaches had. This helped to see the external feedback of how our project came across to others.
