# Week 2

## Weekly Goals 

- Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
- Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
- Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
- Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
- Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

## Self-Review

- Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback :white_check_mark:

Evidence? Reviewed our pair's weekend challenge. Learnt how to provide this feedback on github. 

Assesment? Good useful skill. Having a 2nd pair of eyes on your code is really beneficial, especially from a readability point of view.

## Daily Goals

### Monday 22nd November 

- Attend Mini-Workshop on code review :white_check_mark:

Learnt how to give feedback on a repo in Github.

- Review our weekend challenge 'Airport Challenge' :white_check_mark:

Reviewed our pair partners weekend challenge. Responded to feedback on our own work to help improve our code.

- Pairing on the new challenge :white_check_mark:

Started the Oystercard challenge. Learnt how to create a Gemfile and completed 8 challenges.

- Read up on the use of 'doubles' :white_check_mark:

Within this is the allow statement which lets you set the return value of a method. This is useful for boolean methods or methods with random.

### Tuesday 23rd November 

- Attend Domain Model Diagramming workshop :white_check_mark:

Good idea to picture out Classes, variables/attributes and methods. 

- Progress through the Oystercard challenge :white_check_mark:

Onto the start of challenge 11 now.

- Read more about the use of doubles outside of 'allow' :white_check_mark:

Watched a video explaining how double should be used. It is good to seperate your rspec tests to only test for one class at a time. 

This allows you to really identify where the issues are. Relates to encapsulation.
