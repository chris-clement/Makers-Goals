# Week 2

## Weekly Goals 

- Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
- Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
- Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
- Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
- Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

## Self-Review

- Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this) :white_check_mark:

- Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage] :white_check_mark:

Evidence? In the Oystercard challenge I succesfully split out the project into multiple classes.

Assesment? This is an area I need to focus more on. It is much more straight forward to seperate classes from the beginning but refactoring later is tricky.

- Unit test classes in isolation using mocking :white_check_mark:

Evidence? Use of let and allow was used in both the Oystercard and Takeaway challenge extensively.

Assesment? I understand the need and benefit of testing only one class at a time. Your unit tests should be specific and test for only one true aspect at a time. Mocking allows us to do this.

- Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change) :x:

Evidence? Did not cover this aspect.

Assesment? Need to read up on ease of change.

- Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback :white_check_mark:

Evidence? Reviewed our pair's weekend challenge. Learnt how to provide this feedback on github. 

Assesment? Good useful skill. Having a 2nd pair of eyes on your code is really beneficial, especially from a readability point of view.

## Daily Goals

### Monday 22nd November 

- Attend Mini-Workshop on code review :white_check_mark:

Learnt how to give feedback on a repo in Github.

- Review our weekend challenge 'Airport Challenge' :white_check_mark:

Reviewed our pair partners weekend challenge. Responded to feedback on our own work to help improve our code.

- Pairing on the new challenge :white_check_mark:

Started the Oystercard challenge. Learnt how to create a Gemfile and completed 8 challenges.

- Read up on the use of 'doubles' :white_check_mark:

Within this is the allow statement which lets you set the return value of a method. This is useful for boolean methods or methods with random.

### Tuesday 23rd November 

- Attend Domain Model Diagramming workshop :white_check_mark:

Good idea to picture out Classes, variables/attributes and methods. 

- Progress through the Oystercard challenge :white_check_mark:

Onto the start of challenge 11 now.

- Read more about the use of doubles outside of 'allow' :white_check_mark:

Watched a video explaining how double should be used. It is good to seperate your rspec tests to only test for one class at a time. 

This allows you to really identify where the issues are. Relates to encapsulation.

### Wednesday 24th November 

- Attend EQ Workshop :white_check_mark:

Useful exercise in how to give and receive feedback.

- Fintech Talk from Nomo Bank :white_check_mark:

Interesting talk about how Nomo made a digital bank in just 6 months.

- Process Workshop :white_check_mark:

This was a workshop about working in pairs and someone reviewing your process to tackle a problem.

- Progress on Oystercard challenge :white_check_mark:

Went through just challenge 11.

### Thursday 25th November 

- Progress through the Oystercard challenge :white_check_mark:

Completed 2 challenges.

- Read up more about the use of doubles :white_check_mark:

Watched a few useful videos on this

### Friday 26th November
